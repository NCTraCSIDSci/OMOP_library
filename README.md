# OMOP_library  

### This repository contains code developed by the TraCS Data Science Lab, which is part of the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This code may have been modified from its original form to protect proprietary information and improve interpretability out of context. For example, files paths and schema names have been removed.

This is a repo to centralize OMOP concept sets and other definitions for re-use across projects and OMOP datasets by TraCS Data Science Lab, as well as other groups and researchers both at unc and beyond.  

Concept-baesd definitions are organized by OMOP domain name followed by specific area, for instance an entry to specify hemoglobin A1c labs would appear as 'measurement_a1clabs.md'. If a definition spans multiple OMOP domains this would not be reflected in the title but would be noted in the text describing the concept set.  Other relevant details or necessary context for concept sets will likewise be included in the notes with the definition.  

In addition concept sets, we aso include definitions for data structures we frequently use to explore concepts in OMOP databases, typically organized in a schema called 'research_resources'.
